    <h1>Ancient Number Sequence</h1>
    <p>
      Throughout history, the numbers <strong>3</strong>, <strong>6</strong>, and <strong>9</strong> have appeared
      in architecture, ritual, mathematics, geometry, and personal practice.
      They’re not supernatural in themselves — but they carry a psychological
      and symbolic stability that people have used for thousands of years.
    </p>

    <h2>How the Sequence Began</h2>
    <p>
      Long before modern science, early mathematicians noticed certain numbers
      repeated in nature:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Triads in storytelling and religion (3)</li>
      <li>Hexagonal structures in crystals and honeycomb (6)</li>
      <li>Cycles of completion and return (9)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      These patterns eventually evolved into a kind of “sequence of harmony,”
      where the numbers were treated as anchors for behaviour, intention, and
      self-organisation.
    </p>

    <h2>Tesla & the Ritual of Numbers</h2>
    <p>
      Nikola Tesla, one of history’s most eccentric and brilliant inventors,
      is often associated with the 3–6–9 pattern. While many myths exaggerate
      his beliefs, it is true that Tesla had strict personal habits built around
      repetition and order.
    </p>

        <h3>Walking Around Buildings</h3>
        <p>
          Tesla was known for circling a building multiple times before entering.
          Whether he did it exactly three times every time is debated, but the
          habit reflects his need for rhythm, structure, and mental alignment.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Sets of Six</h3>
        <p>
          He reportedly preferred items in multiples of six — napkins, utensils,
          or steps in a routine. For Tesla, it was a calming repetition, not a
          magical requirement.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>The Sequence as Order</h3>
        <p>
          Tesla viewed the world through patterns. The 3–6–9 ritual was less a 
          belief system and more a method of grounding himself before work.

    <h2>Why the Numbers Feel “Peaceful”</h2>
    <p>
      Many people who follow the sequence describe a sense of:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>calm</strong> from repetition,</li>
      <li><strong>focus</strong> from ritual,</li>
      <li><strong>clarity</strong> from predictable patterns,</li>
      <li><strong>stability</strong> from symbolic structure.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The effect is psychological:  
      when your actions follow a pattern, the mind perceives less chaos.
    </p>

    <h2>The Symbolic Sequence</h2>
    <p>
      In the symbolic traditions explored on this portal, the sequence is treated
      as a metaphor:
    </p>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>3 — Initiation</h3>
      <p>
        The moment of beginning. In practical terms:  
        <em>“Choose one step and take it.”</em>
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>6 — Alignment</h3>
      <p>
        Bringing order to your surroundings.  
        <em>“Stabilise what is unstable.”</em>
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>9 — Completion</h3>
      <p>
        Releasing what no longer serves you.  
        <em>“Close the cycle and prepare for the next.”</em>
      </p>
    </div>

    <hr>

    <h2>The Peace of Sequence in Daily Life</h2>
    <p>
      When people stick to a numerical pattern — whether counting breaths,
      using steps in their routine, or organising the day into sequences —
      they often report:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>a quieter mind,</li>
      <li>a stronger sense of control,</li>
      <li>a ritual that replaces anxiety,</li>
      <li>a feeling of “being in rhythm.”</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      It is less about mystical forces, and more about the way human cognition
      reacts to structure.
    </p>

    <h2>Closing Thought</h2>
    <p>
      Tesla did not find peace from electricity or machinery — he found it in
      patterns. The Ancient Number Sequence is simply a reminder:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <em>“Order is a shelter you can build for yourself.”</em>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Whether you follow 3–6–9, or your own system, the principle is the same:
      <strong>structure creates calm.</strong>
