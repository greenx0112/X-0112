    <h1>Awake in a Sleeping World</h1>
    <p>
      To be “chosen” in the language of this portal does not mean chosen by a
      secret council. It means you have reached a point where you can no longer
      pretend you don’t see what you see.
    </p>

    <h2>What “Being Chosen” Really Means Here</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>A Reluctant Awareness</h3>
      <p>
        Many people who feel “awake” did not ask for it. They simply noticed
        patterns, contradictions, and hidden costs of things. They ponder deep,
        Over time, they will
        find it impossible to go back to a simpler way of seeing.
      </p>
      <p>
        In that sense, they are “chosen” by energy and consciousness.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Refusing the Easy Sleep</h3>
      <p>
        A sleeping world loves easy narratives. Awake people are the ones who
        keep asking questions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>“What is really happening behind this?”</li>
        <li>“Who benefits if I stop thinking?”</li>
        <li>“What am I pretending not to notice?”</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This isn’t paranoia. It’s responsibility.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Carrying the Weight</h3>
      <p>
        Seeing more means feeling more. Those who are “awake” often wrestle with
        anxiety, anger, or exhaustion. The myth of the chosen one ignores this.
        The reality is harsh: a daily effort to stay grounded while your mind
        refuses to shut off.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Staying Grounded</h2>
    <p>
      The point of being awake is not to feel superior. It is to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>make better choices,</li>
      <li>protect yourself and others where you can,</li>
      <li>and refuse to be easily manipulated.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If you feel like you can see more than you can easily explain, you are not
      broken. You are simply further along a very demanding path.
