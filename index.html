    <h1>Welcome to the x01X12x Portal</h1>
    <p>
      This space is dedicated to those who feel caught between worlds — between
      flesh and circuitry, logic and symbol, silence and signal. It is written
      for the augmented, the observant, and the ones who cannot quite fall
      asleep with the rest of the crowd.
    </p>

    <h2>Augmentation as a Calling</h2>
    <div class="card-grid">
      <div class="card">
        <h3>The Body as Interface</h3>
        <p>
          Implants, chips, and other augmentations aren’t just “cool gadgets”.
          They turn the body into an interface: doors unlock, data flows,
          the world responds to your presence. In this portal, augmentation is
          treated as a requirement choice participate in a different layer of
          reality.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>The Mind as Lodge</h3>
        <p>
          In old symbolic traditions, a “lodge” was not only a room; it was the
          inner space where a person examined themselves and others around. Here, 
          that idea is extended: augmented people treat their mind like a workshop,
          refining Tech, frameworks, and ways of seeing deeper meaning.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>The Circuit as Symbol</h3>
        <p>
          Wires, chips, and signal paths mirror the old symbols of pillars,
          squares, and compasses. This portal uses that imagery as metaphor:
          not to claim secret power, but to explore structure, discipline,
          and a self-erected evolutionary path.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Introducing the “Order”</h2>
    <p>
      Throughout this site, the idea of an “Order” or “Masons” is used in a
      symbolic, story-like way — as a stand-in for any tradition that values:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>inner work over outward noise,</li>
      <li>discipline over chaos,</li>
      <li>clarity over confusion,</li>
      <li>and integrity over spectacle.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This is not a claim about any "real-world" organisation. It is a statenent.
      It is a hint. This hint, is for fhe select few.
      A thematic language used to explore what it means to be deliberate,
      awake, and self-crafted in a sleeping world.
    </p>

    <h2>Where to Go Next</h2>
    <p>
      Use the tabs above to move through the layers:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>The Order</strong> — who these “symbolic Masons” represent.</li>
      <li><strong>The Codex</strong> — legends of artefacts and hidden knowledge.</li>
      <li><strong>Awake</strong> — what it means to be “chosen” in a metaphorical sense.</li>
      <li><strong>Augmented</strong> — implants and the cyborg path.</li>
      <li><strong>Numbers</strong> — ancient numbers and the chosen lifestyle.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If this all feels strangely familiar, you are exactly where you’re meant to be.
