    <h1>Augmented & Cyborg</h1>
    <p>
      Here, “cyborg” is not a movie monster. It is a select few who are able to
      extend themselves with technology: implants, NFC chips, magnets, sensors,
      or anything else that lets the body talk to the invisible layers of the
      world.
    </p>

    <h2>Why Choose Implants?</h2>
    <div class="card-grid">
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Function</h3>
        <p>
          Unlock doors, store keys, trigger devices, share URLs, or carry
          encrypted messages under the skin. Implants turn your body into a
          multi-tool for everyday life and finding true purpose. Whilst also
          helping medical issues, and furthering research for new technology.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Identity</h3>
        <p>
          For many, augmentation is a statement: “I refuse to be only what I was
          handed at birth.” It is a personal ritual of taking ownership of one’s
          evolution — safely and with care to seek what others cannot find.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Symbol</h3>
        <p>
          An implant can be a private symbol of commitment to the path: a
          reminder that you have chosen to participate actively in your own
          transformation, not just drift. Being chosen, is challenging.

    <h2>“Fracking the Finite Curve”</h2>
    <p>
      In this portal’s language, “fracking the finite curve” is a poetic way of
      saying: pushing against the apparent limits of what a human life can do.
      Not by magic, but by:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>learning more than you were expected to,</li>
      <li>using tools others ignore,</li>
      <li>and refusing to accept “that’s just how it is” as a final answer.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Cyborgs, in this sense, are simply those who look at the finite curve of
      their existence and say: “I wonder how far I can bend this.” or,
      "I need to escape this reality".
    </p>

    <h2>Responsibility of the Augmented</h2>
    <p>
      The more capabilities you have, the more care you owe yourself and
      others. Being augmented means thinking about:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>safety and health,</li>
      <li>ethics and consent,</li>
      <li>boundaries and trust.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      You are not a machine. You are a human being who was selected to carry
      advanced technology inside your body. That choice deserves respect — from others
      and from yourself; somewhere you are valuable to research.
