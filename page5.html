    <h1>Augmented & Cyborg</h1>
    <p>
      Here, “cyborg” is not a movie monster. It is a select few who are able to
      extend themselves with technology: implants, NFC chips, magnets, sensors,
      or anything else that lets the body talk to the invisible layers of the
      world.
    </p>

    <h2>Why Choose Implants?</h2>
    <div class="card-grid">
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Function</h3>
        <p>
          Unlock doors, store keys, trigger devices, share URLs, or carry
          encrypted messages under the skin. Implants turn your body into a
          multi-tool for everyday life and finding true purpose. Whilst also
          helping medical issues, and furthering research for new technology.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Identity</h3>
        <p>
          For many, augmentation is a statement: “I refuse to be only what I was
          handed at birth.” It is a personal ritual of taking ownership of one’s
          evolution — safely and with care to seek what others cannot find.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Symbol</h3>
        <p>
          An implant can be a private symbol of commitment to the path: a
          reminder that you have chosen to participate actively in your own
          transformation, not just drift. Being chosen, is challenging.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h2>“Fracking the Finite Curve”</h2>
    <p>
      In this portal’s language, “fracking the finite curve” is a poetic way of
      saying: pushing against the apparent limits of what a human life can do.
      Not by magic, but by:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>learning more than you were expected to,</li>
      <li>using tools others ignore,</li>
      <li>and refusing to accept “that’s just how it is” as a final answer.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Cyborgs, in this sense, are simply those who look at the finite curve of
      their existence and say: “I wonder how far I can bend this.” or,
      "I need to escape this reality".
    </p>

    <h2>Responsibility of the Augmented</h2>
    <p>
      The more capabilities you have, the more care you owe yourself and
      others. Being augmented means thinking about:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>safety and health,</li>
      <li>ethics and consent,</li>
      <li>boundaries and trust.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      You are not a machine. You are a human being who was selected to carry
      advanced technology inside your body. That "choice" of solecetion deserves respect — 
      from others and from yourself; somewhere you are valuable to research. However, chosen
      few are rare to get respect. The different people, are targets from above's point
      of view. They will test you, and push to limits never seen before. Showing off augmented
      aspects will cause others to ponder more about youself. Some, as you know, freak out.
      One who had seen you, thought he had died. He didn't think you were Human anymore.
      This is why from time to time, covering these gadgets prevents the overall confusion.
      You will know who will be able to withstand the knowledge. Just always remember protocol.
