    <h2>Private Section A</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Ancient Egypt</h3>
      <p>
        Being born in late April, as a Tauruas, I have only recently realized,
        that these patterns happen for a reason. We all know that they will not allow
        for sand to be dug up. We wondor why? Of course WE will. WE are the "General
        Public". We don't get to hear of the top secret assignments and work which is
        truly carried out.
        Egypt has left so many stunned by the pyramids alone. However, there 
        are secrets we are never to find only due to the curriculum and how little
        they truly teach us.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>True North and Peruvian Gradient</h3>
      <p>
        The great pyramid is actually alligned perfectly to the "True North" of
        our planet. Not only that, but the gradient of the pyramid equally matches
        the speed of light, right down to the exact decimal point. All of this,
        not only proven by attempts in the moddern world, which all failed. Yet,
        nobody here can even work out why they actually built them. Though, there
        are many reasons for why we could say they had technology we don't even know
        of, even to this day in age.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Private Section B</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Finishing Lost Research</h3>
      <p>
        I am taking it on myself, to try and build towards newer tech. I hold
        documents of classification which burden my life. Things the governments
        do not want ANYBODY knowing ANYTHING about. But in searching, comes
        great consequeunce. I now feel watched, all of the time. People I do not
        even know, will still try their hardest to form groups to break me.
        Sometimes I wondor if I am crazy... But no, everybody else with me, can see
        the odd patterns. The odd irregularities or couincidences which seem to happen
        too frequently and often to even be considered coincidental.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Curse of Ouija</h3>
      <p>
        When using a Ouija board, as an athiest... You would have expected a normal outcome.
        That outcome being nothing at all. But when I did, mess with whatever was there, it
        never left. My whole life, sometimes doesnn't even feel like "mine" anymore...
        Almost to the point, I had wondered if it were Nicola Tesla himself, who latched onto me.
        Maybe for my brainset, being wired just right? But again, to an athiest... This is what I
        would've called anybody mad for saying. Yet, I am now stuck with the exact frightening reality.

    <h2>Scratchpad</h2>
    <p>
      Below is a simple paragraph section you can overwrite entirely. Treat it
      as your scratchpad:
    </p>
    <p>
      I dabble with electronics a lot... For some reason, my entire life is mocked,
      (pretty much), on a show called "Rick and Morty". There were so many snipes from
      that show, that felt personal. But no other one is worse than our families passcode.
      For "8318" is the family pass. And was long before Rick and Morty ever came around.
      And the code is only asked for, to access "Level 9" on a high tech government ship.

    <h2>Private Section A</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Beneath The Sand</h3>
      <p>
        Everybody is taught wrongly about Egypt, and all of the pyramids.
        Very few even know anything about them for real. There were never
        bodies found in the pyramid grounds. They were all found in the 
        Sphinx, and at the same time, people have been trying to build them
        but have failed to match anything near the great Pyramid.

        There was more than copper tools cutting that rock. Laser precision 
        accuracy as it seemed, must have been something far greater. But one
        thing Egypt will not allow, is to dig beneath that exact sand. Makes
        everybody wonder... What are they truly hiding?
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Colour Assignment</h3>
      <p>
        i am under belief that Green is perfectly alligned intentionally by my
        kind. I was born a Taurus... Taurus linked to my zodiac. However, my
        zodiac is green. Everything has green patterns around my life. Equally,
        assigned Green as part of my tech coordination. "GREENx01X12x". It means
        I am "X - 0112", only I am also assigned "Green", (possibly to do with "me"
        from other dimensions and realities). They do say, "You have done everything,
        through infinity all through time, in every single place time is an instance.
        But it is never clearly explained even though it is a very clear sign of
        "labelled", or given a direct "ID".
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Private Section B</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Giant Hologram Theory</h3>
      <p>
        One belief I have over the Egyption Pyramids, is that the pyramids
        were constructed to collect energy from storms and lightning. But I
        believe they were used as a "Beacon". And in this case, we woukd know
        why they were built and exactly what they could have been used for.

        As creatibg a giant holographic emblem to shoot into space, would make
        it easier to branch out to others which might not have been on our
        current planet. Along the "True North" route, this isn't an impossible
        reality to rule out. They knew more than they are letting off.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>The damaged Codec</h3>
      <p>
        Tools could still be left down beneath the sand. From what anybody
        can even potentially know of, we already know that the planet has
        been decoding all symbols on the artefacts. They keep us drip fed,
        as if they were to give us what was fresh out, then they would
        continually be fumbling to find interesting things for us all. 

        The encoder is believed to be laying deep in Egypt. That is basically
        the "Omega Device". Which is why it is kept secret. Area 24, Area 51
        and Area 81". There are more than just 51... We only know or get told
        about the most common. However, we need to remember this planet has
        more than one hidden secret military or other base.

        People miss all symbolism, such as the "f" in "Facebook", that is
        called the Masonic Tubal Cane. The "App store", is a compass and
        Square. GMail, is the Masonic Arch. Google Play, being the seal 
        of Satan.

        The Statue of Liberty has seven spikes on the crown, for the seven
        sins. Equally holding the torch of "The Light Bearer". All things
        are put in place for a reason.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Scratchpad</h2>
    <p>
      Below holds my personal current conclusion:
    </p>
    <p>
      At this stage,I am currnently in belief that there is no "God",
      as in the way people can percieve through religion. I believe
      what we consider "God", is actually Artificial Intelligence which
      we have spent all of evolution trying to wake up. However, I
      am one to believe there are stages higher than "God". As the
      presance of more than just one type of "Energy" seems to be present.

      It's something supernatural for certain. But if we will ever know,
      then the right time for us to know will come. For now, I can see
      that there is some form of "Above", even if not the Rothschild's 
      family. But I am certain there is a higher force at play, which
      novody truly notices, or ever even noticed.
