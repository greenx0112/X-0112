    <h2>Private Section A</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Ancient Egypt</h3>
      <p>
        Being born in late April, as a Tauruas, I have only recently realized,
        that these patterns happen for a reason. We all know that they will not allow
        for sand to be dug up. We wondor why? Of course WE will. WE are the "General
        Public". We don't get to hear of the top secret assignments and work which is
        truly carried out.
        Egypt has left so many stunned by the pyramids alone. However, there 
        are secrets we are never to find only due to the curriculum and how little
        they truly teach us.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>True North and Peruvian Gradient</h3>
      <p>
        The great pyramid is actually alligned perfectly to the "True North" of
        our planet. Not only that, but the gradient of the pyramid equally matches
        the speed of light, right down to the exact decimal point. All of this,
        not only proven by attempts in the moddern world, which all failed. Yet,
        nobody here can even work out why they actually built them. Though, there
        are many reasons for why we could say they had technology we don't even know
        of, even to this day in age.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Private Section B</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Finishing Lost Research</h3>
      <p>
        I am taking it on myself, to try and build towards newer tech. I hold
        documents of classification which burden my life. Things the governments
        do not want ANYBODY knowing ANYTHING about. But in searching, comes
        great consequeunce. I now feel watched, all of the time. People I do not
        even know, will still try their hardest to form groups to break me.
        Sometimes I wondor if I am crazy... But no, everybody else with me, can see
        the odd patterns. The odd irregularities or couincidences which seem to happen
        too frequently and often to even be considered coincidental.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Curse of Ouija</h3>
      <p>
        When using a Ouija board, as an athiest... You would have expected a normal outcome.
        That outcome being nothing at all. But when I did, mess with whatever was there, it
        never left. My whole life, sometimes doesnn't even feel like "mine" anymore...
        Almost to the point, I had wondered if it were Nicola Tesla himself, who latched onto me.
        Maybe for my brainset, being wired just right? But again, to an athiest... This is what I
        would've called anybody mad for saying. Yet, I am now stuck with the exact frightening reality.

    </p>
    <p>
      I dabble with electronics a lot... For some reason, my entire life is mocked,
      (pretty much), on a show called "Rick and Morty". There were so many snipes from
      that show, that felt personal. But no other one is worse than our families passcode.
      For "8318" is the family pass. And was long before Rick and Morty ever came around.
      And the code is only asked for, to access "Level 9" on a high tech government ship.
