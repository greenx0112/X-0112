    <!-- ================== Private Section A ================== -->
    <h2>Private Section A</h2>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Ancient Egypt</h3>
      <p>
        Being born in late April, as a Taurus, I have only recently realised
        that these patterns happen for a reason. We all know that they will not
        allow for sand to be dug up. We wonder why? Of course WE will. WE are
        the “general public”. We don’t get to hear of the top-secret assignments
        and work that is truly carried out.
        Egypt has left so many stunned by the pyramids alone. However, there
        are secrets we are never to find, only due to the curriculum and how
        little they truly teach us.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>True North and Peruvian Gradient</h3>
      <p>
        The Great Pyramid is aligned perfectly to the true north of our planet.
        Not only that, but the gradient of the pyramid matches the speed of
        light, right down to the decimal point. Attempts in the modern world
        have failed to recreate this. All of this is proven, yet nobody can
        truly explain why they built them. There are reasons to believe they
        had technology we still do not understand, even now.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Beneath the Sand</h3>
      <p>
        Everybody is taught wrongly about Egypt and the pyramids. There were
        never bodies found in the pyramid grounds; they were found in the
        Sphinx. At the same time, modern builders have tried and failed to match
        the precision of the Great Pyramid.
        There was more than copper tools cutting that rock. Laser-precision
        accuracy suggests something far greater. But one thing Egypt will not
        allow is digging beneath that exact sand. It makes everybody wonder:
        what are they truly hiding?
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Colour Assignment</h3>
      <p>
        I am under the belief that green is perfectly aligned intentionally by
        my kind. I was born a Taurus — Taurus linked to my zodiac. My zodiac is
        green. Everything has green patterns around my life. I am assigned green
        as part of my tech coordination: <strong>GREENx01X12x</strong>.
        It means I am “X-0112”, also assigned “Green”, possibly connected to
        versions of me from other dimensions and realities.
        They say, “You have done everything, through infinity and through all
        time, in every place.” It sounds like a label, an ID, not just a colour.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- ================== Private Section B ================== -->
    <h2>Private Section B</h2>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Finishing Lost Research</h3>
      <p>
        I am taking it on myself to build towards newer tech. I feel like I hold
        classified documents that burden my life — things governments do not
        want anybody knowing about. But in searching comes great consequence.
        I feel watched all the time. People I do not even know seem to form
        groups just to break me.
        Sometimes I wonder if I am crazy… but no, everybody with me can see the
        odd patterns. The irregularities and “coincidences” happen too often to
        be coincidence.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Curse of Ouija</h3>
      <p>
        When using a Ouija board as an atheist, you would expect nothing at all.
        But when I did, whatever was there never left. My life sometimes doesn’t
        feel like mine anymore. I even wondered if it were Nikola Tesla himself,
        who latched on to me — maybe for my mindset, wired just right.
        As an atheist, I once would have called anyone mad for saying that.
        Now I am stuck with the frightening possibility.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Giant Hologram Theory</h3>
      <p>
        One belief I have about the Egyptian pyramids is that they were
        constructed to collect energy from storms and lightning, used as a
        beacon. A giant holographic emblem fired into the sky would make it
        easier to reach others that might not have been on our planet.
        Aligned along true north, this is not an impossible reality to consider.
        They knew more than they are letting on.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>The Damaged Codec</h3>
      <p>
        Tools could still be left beneath the sand. From what we can know, the
        world has been decoding symbols on artefacts for years, drip-feeding us
        results. If they gave us everything at once, they would run out of
        distractions.
        The encoder may lie deep in Egypt — the “Omega Device”. That is why it
        is kept secret. Area 21, Area 51, Area 81… there are more than we are
        told.
      </p>
      <p>
        People miss the symbolism: the <strong>f</strong> in Facebook as the
        Masonic Tubal Cain; the App Store icon as compass and square; Gmail as
        the arch; Google Play as a seal. The Statue of Liberty has seven spikes
        for the seven sins, holding the torch of the “light bearer”. Nothing is
        placed there by accident.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- ================== Scratchpad ================== -->
    <h2>Scratchpad</h2>
    <p>
      I dabble with electronics a lot. For some reason, my life feels mocked in
      a show like <em>Rick and Morty</em>. There are so many snipes that feel
      personal. None is worse than our family passcode. “8318” has been our
      family code long before that show, yet in the show it’s used to access
      “Level 9” on a high-tech government ship.
    </p>

    <p>
      At this stage, I am currently in belief that there is no “God” in the way
      people perceive through religion. What we call “God” might be an
      intelligence we have spent all of evolution trying to wake up. I suspect
      there are stages higher than “God” — multiple kinds of energy present.
      Whatever it is, it feels supernatural.
      If we ever fully know, it will be when we are meant to. For now, I can
      see that there is some form of “above”, even if it isn’t a bloodline like
      the Rothschilds. I am certain there is a higher force at play that most
      people never notice.
