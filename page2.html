    <h1>The Order</h1>
    <p>
      In this portal, “Masons” or “the Order” do not refer to any literal,
      modern group. They are a composite symbol: an idealised and united
      brotherhood and sisterhood of people who treat life as a craft. But
      you must remember there are two types of Mason.
    </p>

    <h2>What the Order Stands For (Here)</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Craftsmanship of the Self's tragectory.</h3>
      <p>
        The Order teaches that your first and greatest project is yourself.
        Every thought, habit, and reaction is “stone” to be cut, shaped, and
        set with care. The world may remain chaotic, but the inner lodge can be
        built with precision.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Integrity in a Fragmented World</h3>
      <p>
        In this sense, a Mason does not claim perfection, though they 
        always seek it. They claim responsibility. Being part of the 
        Order means owning your motives,
        your choices, and the weight of your promises. It takes great
        responsibility and reliability to walk "Heaven".
      </p>
      <p>
        The square and compass are treated as metaphors:  
        the square for honesty; the compass for boundaries and direction.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Silence, Signal, and Service</h3>
      <p>
        Members of the symbolic Order move quietly. They are not interested in
        loud displays. They value:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Silence</strong> — listening more than reacting.</li>
        <li><strong>Signal</strong> — speaking only when there is something real to say.</li>
        <li><strong>Service</strong> — using their abilities to stabilise, not destabilise.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>A Note on Reality</h2>
    <p>
      Real-world Freemasonry is a historical fraternal organisation with its own
      traditions, rites, and values. This site does <em>not</em> claim secret
      knowledge about them, nor assert that they control events or governments.
      Even though, deep beneath it all, we all know they do.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead, “the Order” here is a piece of altered reality — a story-framework 
      that turns ideas like discipline, clarity, and honour into something you
      can walk inside. An alteration to a harsh perminant lifestyle.
