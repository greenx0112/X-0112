    <h1>The Codex & the Hidden Archive</h1>
    <p>
      In the lore of the x01X12x Portal, “the Codex” is the imagined book that
      never quite stays in one place: a shifting archive of symbols, artefacts,
      and half-remembered truths. It is not a literal, real-world document, but a
      way of talking about all the knowledge that feels like it is just out of reach.
    </p>

    <h2>Artefacts of the Story</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>The Compass That Points Inward</h3>
      <p>
        This unknown artefact does not point north. It swings wildly in the
        outer world but settles the moment the carrier is honest with themselves.
        In the Codex, it stands for the idea that direction in life comes only
        when you seek to find out who you really are.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>The Square of Uncomfortable Truths</h3>
      <p>
        Another symbolic tool, the Square in the Codex “buzzes” whenever someone
        bends reality to spare what bends around them. It reminds the Initiate that
        accuracy and discomfort often arrive together.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>The Sealed Pages</h3>
      <p>
        Whole chapters of the Codex are described as sealed. Not by governments,
        but by the reader’s own readiness. Some knowledge, the story insists,
        cannot be opened from the outside; it unlocks itself when you are able
        to carry the burden of it.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Hidden Things & Governments (In Lore)</h2>
    <p>
      The idea of hidden rooms beneath government buildings,
      locked vaults, and lost artefacts. In this portal, such images are used
      purely as symbolic reference — not as factual claims, being hushed by
      real institutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, “the things governments hide” become shorthand for:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>the parts of reality we collectively ignore,</li>
      <li>truths that are overlooked by most, equally supernatural,</li>
      <li>and the consequences of decisions people don’t want to look at.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The Codex is about actual hidden artefacts, and more about the
      feeling that there is always more beneath the surface than we’re being
      shown — including our drip-fed minds.
